About
=====

We built Article Builder after creating and maintaining several article-type applications such as django-stories and django-viewpoint and still not getting it right. So much is shared between article-type content, and yet there are always project-specific or implementation-specific tweaks.

Article Builder provides a basic core to article-type content. It is a set of abstract classes meant to be subclassed. With Article Builder you can build a news application, a blog, news announcements or whatever your imagination (or the current project) dreams up.

It should allow you to create a model by simply subclassing the pieces you need and nothing else.
